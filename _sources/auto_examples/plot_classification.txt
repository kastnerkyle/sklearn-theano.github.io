=================================================
Classification and top N prediction probabilities
=================================================

In this example, an image is input to an OverfeatClassifier, and the top N
probability outputs are plotted as a bar graph. The red box represents the
cropping window on the input - because input is forced to be 231x231, a center
box of size 231x231 is taken from the larger image to perform classification.

In general, the top N probability outputs represent the most likely potential
classes for the OverfeatClassifier.
