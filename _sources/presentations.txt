New to Scientific Python?
==========================
For those that are still new to the scientific Python ecosystem, we highly
recommend the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes
<http://scipy-lectures.github.io/>`_. This will help you find your footing a
bit and will definitely improve your sklearn-theano experience.  A basic
understanding of NumPy arrays is recommended to make the most of scikit-learn.

A decent grasp of `Theano <http://deeplearning.net/software/theano>`_
is also useful for developers who wish to build their own modules
or contribute.
